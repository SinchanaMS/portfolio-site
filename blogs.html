            <h2>Mental Health Is A Journey:Let's Walk Together</h2>
            <small>November 21, 2021</small>
            <p>I am not a mental healthcare professional nor am I trained in dealing with mental health crisis. I am
                someone who is working on my own mental health daily. I do want to share my story and my ongoing journey
                with you. Mostly, I want you to know you are not alone. If you are experiencing a mental health crisis,
                please call your local emergency contact number.</p>

            <h2>What is a blog??</h2>
            <small>November 20, 2021</small>
            <p>blog, in full Web log or Weblog, online journal where an individual, group, or corporation presents a
                record of activities, thoughts, or beliefs. Some blogs operate mainly as news filters, collecting
                various online sources and adding short comments and Internet links. Other blogs concentrate on
                presenting original material. In addition, many blogs provide a forum to allow visitors to leave
                comments and interact with the publisher. “To blog” is the act of composing material for a blog.
                Materials are largely written, but pictures, audio, and videos are important elements of many blogs. The
                “blogosphere” is the online universe of blogs.</p>
